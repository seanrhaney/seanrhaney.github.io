<li><h4> Langmuir-Submesoscale Interactions </h4></li>
<p>Sean's current research is on interactions between Langmuir Turbulence and submesoscale fronts.  Global climate models that include submesoscale eddy parametrizations have shown systematically shallow mixed layer depths.  One possible explanation for this is that the mixing effects of waves are not included in any parametrization.  Submesoscale eddies use the available potential energy in a submesoscale front to restratify the mixed layer.  This is often referred to as mixing or stirring by eddies, but in fact, the eddies are <b>UN</b>mixing in the vertical direction.  At the same time, the waves induce a net current in the direction of propagation called stokes drift, which is strong at the surface, but decays exponentially with depth.  The stokes drift tilts vorticity anomalies into the direction of wave propagation causing counter-rotating vortices aligned (or anti-aligned) with the wave direction.  These counter-rotating vortices have zones of surface convergence and divergence.  Along the convergence zones, the surface wind stress greatly accelerates flow in the downwind direction, and thus helps to increase the vertical vorticity that creates the Langmuir cell after tilting by Stokes drift.  Since the Stokes drift has tilted a vertical vorticiy anomaly into the horizontal, that increases the cross wind and vertical velocities, and therefore mixes the upper ocean vertically.  It is this compettion between unmixing by eddies, and mixing by waves and winds that is of great interest.  To know if and when the respective mechanisms matter, i.e. is there some parameter of the larger scale flow that can help explain when the temperature gradients are important, and when the waves and winds are important.  But even more then that, one might want to know how these mechanisms interact.  To study this, <p>

<li><h4> Hurricane Wake Restratification </h4></li>
When a hurricane passes over the ocean, intense winds mix the upper ocean mixed layer with the uncerlying water in the thermocline, resulting in a cooler surface temperature, and less stratified (than befor the storm) layer of water.  This is referred to as the hurricane wake.  The timescale and mechanism for hurricane restratification can have implications for the local ecology, future SST conditions that might affect future hurricanes, and the meridional heat transport.
